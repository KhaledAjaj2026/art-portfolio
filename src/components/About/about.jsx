            <p>KaleHead is an artist. He draws things that come to mind. When he draws the whole world pauses. It sounds poetic but it is true: the orbit of the earth, the gate of walking city-folk, and time itself, all comes to a halt. That is how he seemingly counjures art out of nowhere in an impossible amount of time: none at all. He draws whatever comes to mind, sometimes cute and sometimes epic. He really likes chocolate. That is all to be said about KaleHead.</p>
